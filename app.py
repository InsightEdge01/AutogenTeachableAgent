#learning new facts---- define zephyr model"Zephyr is a series of language models that are trained to act as helpful assistants. Zephyr-7B-Î± is the first model in the series, and is a fine-tuned version of mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1 that was trained on on a mix of publicly available, synthetic datasets using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

#Consider the identity:
#9 * 5 + 6 * 6 = 72
#Can you modify exactly one integer (and not more than that!) on the left hand side of the equation so the right hand side becomes 99?
#Let's think step-by-step, write down a plan, and then write down your solution as: "The solution is: A * B + C * D".
